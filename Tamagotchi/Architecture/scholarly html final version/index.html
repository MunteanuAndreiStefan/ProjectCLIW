                Create a MV * mini-framework for the development of vector-driven vector-based web applications at the client level. As an actual case study, it will be used to implement a Tamagotchi game simulator. At the very least, each authenticated user will manage
                one or more characters he will take care of (nourish, educate, amuse). The Web application will provide an interactive way to create and configure these characters, plus sharing them to users. Bonus: Implementing a level message routing
                system client to build SPA-Single Page Applications.

            <h2>The progress of the project</h2>
            <p>As it is written <a href="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/cliw/web-projects.html">here</a>, the project evaluation has three parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prototype of the Web interface</li>
                <li>The architecture of the application</li>
                <li>The fully functional solution</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the first part, we developed the prototype of the Web interface according to the requirements. It can be found on our repository, together with the corresponding html scholarly report.</p>
            <p>
                For second part of the evaluation, we established the architecture of our application and made some diagrams for a better understanding of it, by taking into account the ideas we had when we worked for the first part of the evaluation.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this part of the evaluation we had to deliver the functional solution, based on what we already established in the previous stages:the user interface and the architecture. Excepting some insignificant changes, the application follows the ideas we
                established during the semester.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our high-level goals were to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make the main modules and integrate them into our application.</li>
                <li>Make our application as a SPA - Single Page Application, in order to do so we had to be careful at routing.</li>
                <li>Based on the use-cases, establish which actions are allowed for a user.</li>
                <li>Interact with the database.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here is a reminder of our sketches which helped us make the application. </p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>
                In order to understand the structure of our application, we present the main concepts regarding the architecture.
            </p>
            <section typeof="sa:Framework" id="framework">
                <h3>Framework</h3>
                <p>
                    We created an js engine for working with svg that is able to run animations on color, transform, size or text type animations. The framework is created respecting the svg structure and each node is called nodeSVG into it. The framework allows to draw
                    any type of form by circle/elipse/rect/path. The framework also treats the events like hover and onclick. We used this framework to create/edit the tamagotchis and to interact with them.

            </section>
            <section typeof="sa:ArchitecturalPattern" id="spa">
                <h3>SPA</h3>
                <p>A single page application interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading new pages. This type of application is popular among the developers because of several advantages, such as avoiding interruption
                    of user experience, although it might be more difficult to create. There are various techniques which can be used when creating such applications: use of some JavaScript frameworks, AJAX, Websockets, Browser plugins.
                </p>
                <p>In our application, we use JS in order to dinamically modify what the user can see in the page, in order to simulate the routing experience. Each "page" is managed as a div and its presence and content are dinamically modified based on
                    how the user is using the app. We also check whether the user is authentified.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section typeof="sa:Modules" id="modules">
                <h3>Modules</h3>
                <p>The modules are built according to the functionalities offered by our application. The following list contains the main modules, together with the corresponding submodules.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Users management
                        <ul>
                            <li>Login</li>
                            <li>Register</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tamagotchi management
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create tamagotchi</li>
                            <li>Edit tamagotchi</li>
                            <li>View tamagotchi</li>
                            <li>Remove tamagotchi</li>
                            <li>Share tamagotchi</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Login submodule has the role of authenticating the existing users, in order to give them access to all the facilities offered by our application. It has to be provided the user credentials.</p>
                <p>Register submodule has the role of creating new accounts, based on the forms submitted by the persons who wish to sign up.</p>
                <p>Create tamagotchi submodule has the role of inserting new tamagotchies into the database, by using the data provided by the authenticated users. The data consists of features selected by the users for the new tamagotchies, such as color
                    or body shape.
                </p>
                <p>Edit tamagotchi submodule is similar to the previous one, but the users need to select an existing tamagotchi and modify some of its features. The characteristics of the tamagotchi will be updated in the database.</p>
                <p>View tamagotchi submodule lets the users visualise a selected tamagotchi and perform several actions such as feeding or entertaining.</p>
                <p>Remove tamagotchi submodule lets the users delete a tamagotchi from their account in the database.</p>
                <p>Share tamagotchi submodule makes possible the sharing among users of their tamagotchies, by entering the user who the current user would like to give a tamagotchi.</p>
                <p>The modules/submodules interact with each other in different ways, depending on the use-cases. However, there is a permanent dependence between the two main modules - the users management module decides, by whether authenticating a user
                    or not, which actions can be performed by the tamagotchi management module for a certain user.
                </p>
                <p>The functions of each module, the way they interact with each other/the user and the way the user can access each function in the interface are detailed in the following sections, using diagrams and written explanations when necessary.</p>

                    Regarding the data exchange in our application, the submodules that are in charge of the users management interact mainly with the database because it keeps track of the existing users and their accounts, but also with mail servers, due to the fact that
                    every account requires an email address at creation time.
                </p>
                <p> Who wishes to register first needs to complete a form with some personal information, including an email address. The data is verified (especially the validity of the email address). If something is wrong the user is notified, otherwise
                    he/she gets a confirmation email. After the user confirms, an account is created and inserted into the database, and now the user can enjoy the facilities of our application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An existing user may login into our application by entering his/her credentials. The login process queries the database and if the requested account is found and the password is correct, the user is granted access into the application, otherwise an error
                    is returned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the data flows described in the above paragraphs can be visualised in the Authentication diagram.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An authenticated user can enjoy the facilities of our application. The tamagotchi management modules intermediate the transfer of data between the user and the database, considering that the database is storing the properties of the tamagotchies created
                    by the users and also some animations which make the tamagotchi more fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a user wants to create a new tamagotchi, he/she needs to set its properties. Some of them are mentioned below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>name</li>
                    <li>face shape - possible values are based on geometric figures</li>
                    <li>eyes shape - the setting of this parameter is done just like in the case of the face shape</li>
                    <li>mouth - for a plus of expressivity, the mouth can be adjusted in order to reflect the character's feelings</li>
                    <li>torso - body shape</li>
                    <li>face color</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When the user presses the save button, the data is collected in order to be used at tamagotchi creation. After the new tamagotchi is created and inserted into the database it becomes available to the user.</p>
                <p>Editing is similar, except the user modifies an existing tamagotchi. Therefore, the corresponding tamagotchi in the database will be updated with the new data collected from the user. </p>
                <p>When a user needs to view a tamagotchi, the application queries the database and after the tamagotchi is found, it will be loaded in the view page.</p>
                <p>Tamagotchies can also be removed from the database, at the user's request.</p>
                <p>Another facility is the sharing of tamagotchies among users via user IDs.</p>
                <p>The data flow described in the above paragraphs can be seen in the Tama Management diagram.</p>

                <p>Firebase Realtime Database is a NoSql cloud database developed by Google. It has several features, like data syncronization in realtime, the ability to work even offline (when the connection is reestablished the client gets the changes
                    from the server) or scaling. More details can be found <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>We will use the database to keep the track of the existing users, their tamagotchies, and also some animations associated with the tamagotchies. </p>

                <p>
                    For the validation part we used w3c validators online for css and html. For internal purposes we are going to use selenium or any other frontend testing tool available for the next phases.
