      <h2>The problem we start from</h2>
	  <p> This problem was proposed to us during cliw lab, you can find more about it <a href="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/cliw/projects/">here</a>.
	  </p>
      <p>
Create a MV * mini-framework for the development of vector-driven vector-based web applications at the client level.
As an actual case study, it will be used to implement a Tamagotchi game simulator.
At the very least, each authenticated user will manage one or more characters he will take care of
(nourish, educate, amuse). The Web application will provide an interactive way to create and configure these characters,
plus sharing them to users. Bonus: Implementing a level message routing system
client to build SPA-Single Page Applications.

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>
        The project for this part of the evaluation started with some sketches and long discussion about what and where should look.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our high-level goals are to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a layout sketch for our application.</li>
        <li>Have a style template for the project.</li>
        <li>Have layout parts for the game.</li>
        <li>Create a mvp.</li>
        <li>Create a base for us to start developing the arhitecture.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Our project Tama should have a html document that is a valid <a role="doc-biblioref">HTML</a> document that follows
        some additional rules to specialize its meaning and make it predictable to processors
        wishing to produce or consume scholarly articles. These rules are outlined in the following
        sections.
      </p>
      <section id="Root">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>Part 1</h3>
        <p>
          The document must be encoded in UTF-8 and transmitted with a media type of
          <code>text/html</code>.
        </p>
      </section>
	  <section id="Root">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>Edit page</h3>
        <p>
          This page allows the user to edit the tamagotchi characters. There are many available options so that the user can customize the tamagotchi character in the way he/she likes, just like in any other computer/mobile game, where you can set up your profile.
          By making use of the numerous possible combinations of shapes, colors, or items, there can be created fun and original tamagotchis. 
          The options refer to the following aspects of the tamagotchi: face shape, eyes shape, mouth, accesory, costume, face color.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>face shape - possible values are based on geometric figures</li>
          <li>eyes shape - the setting of this parameter is done just like in the case of the face shape</li>
          <li>mouth - for a plus of expressivity, the mouth can be adjusted in order to reflect the character's feelings</li>
          <li>costume - the user can choose the character's clothes, from a set of predefined items</li>
          <li>accesory - cool accesories like hats or helmets are provided in addition to the costume</li>
          <li>face color - the user can pick any color by selecting the corresponding HSLA (Hue,Saturation,Lightness,Alpha) values</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The interface is user-friendly - it adjusts to the dimensions of the user's screen, by properly scaling the tamagotchi and positioning the other page content.
          The options are scrollable, to assure that the user doesn't lose any information when he/she uses the site on a small screen.
          The page controls, like the buttons used to iterate through a list of possible values corresponding to a certain option, are intuitive and don't require the user to read a complicate guide in order to use the application.
          After the user is done editing, he/she can save the changes by clicking Save.

        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <p>
          The only validation requirement for Scholarly HTML at this point is that the HTML is valid.
          We are considering building a a validation tool in RelaxNG or JavaScript to check compliance
          with this set of rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Articles should be in the following basic structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>heading with article title</li>
          <li>0+ hunks</li>
          <li>
            0+ sections
            <ul>
              <li>0+ headings</li>
              <li>0+ hunks</li>
              <li>0+ sections</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It must feature a <code>DOCTYPE</code> as its preamble.

      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
      <p>
        Scholarly HTML would like to thank <a href="http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly HTML</a>
        (you read that right) for blazing the trail perhaps a few years too soon. Particularly,
        the following people were particularly kind and helpful:
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ptsefton">Peter Sefton</a>,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/blahah404">Richard Smith-Unna</a>, and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/petermurrayrust">Peter Murray-Rust</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        PLOS has a
        <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/19/a-very-brief-history-of-scholarly-html/">short
        history of Scholarly HTML</a> that is worth reading (and would be worth updating).
      </p>
      <p>
        Dan Brickley was kind enough to drop by the office to chat about our usage of
        <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> even though he was tired and hungry. As
        always, examples involving fish tanks are the most helpful. Dave Cramer shared ideas
        that we happily stole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patrick Johnston’s input has been crucial, notably in modeling authoring. We can only
        hope that getting those details exactly right have not caused him to lose too much
        sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also received very useful feedback and pointers from: Kjetil Kjernsmo (DAHUT!),
        Silvio Peroni, Justin Johansson, Alf Eaton, Raniere Silvia, Kaveh Bazargan and Mike
        Smith. We are very much indebted to the help provided us by Ivan Herman.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we somehow forgot you in this list and you are too gracious to complain, we love you
        all the same.
